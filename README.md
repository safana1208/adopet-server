```

## Deployment

- The admin panel is part of the client-side repo, but accessible only to admin users after login.
- Admin login is identified via phone number and password from the database.
- All data interactions are made via API requests to the [Render-hosted backend](https://adopet-server.onrender.com).

## Notes

- Admin access is restricted and validated via login.
- Adoption requests update both pet status and request status.
- Statistics are fetched dynamically from MongoDB via Express backend.

## Example Admin Flow

1. Admin logs in via login.html (with phone/password)
2. Redirected to `admin-dashboard.html`
3. Views, adds, edits, or deletes pets
4. Navigates to `admin-requests.html` to manage adoption requests
5. Reviews platform data via `admin-stats.html`
